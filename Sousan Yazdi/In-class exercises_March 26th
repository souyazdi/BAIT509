Construct the decision rule according to this classification boundary. How would you classify a new observation that has x1=6 and x2=10?
* Decision rule is set based on the middle line as the classification boundary.
*This observation is classified as "A", but since it falls within the margin, receives a penalty equal to the proportion of the way 
through the margin it is. The penalty is (3/4)*2 = 1.5

What size is the margin here? 
* Margin size is 2

Which observations receive a penalty? Which observations are the support vectors?
* No difference between these two terms.
* 6 - 7- 9 - 10 and 8: They cross their marginal boundary

What is the total penalty here?
* 0.25 + 0.25 + 1.75 + 1.25 = 3.5

Can I choose a bigger margin if my total allowable penalty is 6?
* 

Are the data separable? If so, what are the support vectors?
* Yes, a margin with support vectors of 4 - 8 - 9
